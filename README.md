StatemachineExample
===================

A python example of how to design and implement a state machine for a certain task.

This project is primarily a tutorial of how to start with a desired behavior (What you want to happen and when it should happen) and design/implement a program to accomplish it.

I will be implementing a 4 pin 'security system' like on some safes or house security systems. There are several folders that each implement this pin system in a different way, building on the previous implementation. Each implementation elaborates the previous one, incrementally intoducing greater modularity and helpful abstractions which should reduce repetition and complexity. 

Each folder will contain a readme explaining criticisms of the previous implementation, followed by an explanation of how those issues were addressed.

I do expect you have a basic understanding of the Python programming language, and how to define functions
