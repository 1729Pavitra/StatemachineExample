"""This is a weird python thing. In order to correctly be able to import files 
from a folder, it needs to be marked by python as a folder containing python 
code files. The check? Simply looking if there is an __init__.py file in the 
folder. If you try to import from a folder that doesn't have this file... it 
usually will not work. You can do some interesting things with this file that I 
will not explain for at least a while... maybe ever."""
